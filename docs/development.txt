Developing for MontySolr needs the project setup (which we could perhaps simplify):

- add references to the lucene_solr_3_1 project libraries
- add source to the java build path
- include path to the JCC classes as an external class folder (/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/JCC-2.7-py2.6-macosx-10.6-universal.egg/classes)



Prerequisities:

   - g++ compiler
        $ sudo apt-get install g++
        
   - Python headers
        $ sudo apt-get install python-dev
        
   - Python setuptools
        $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
        
   - Ant, SVN, Git
        $ sudo apt-get install subversion, ant, git
