Developing for MontySolr needs the project setup (which we could perhaps simplify):

- add references to the lucene_solr_3_1 project libraries
- add source to the java build path
- include path to the JCC classes as an external class folder (/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/JCC-2.7-py2.6-macosx-10.6-universal.egg/classes)
