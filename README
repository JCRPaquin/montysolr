ABOUT MONTYSOLR
---------------

MontySolr is an open source extension that makes it possible to include Python 
code inside Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr). You can call Python routines
from the Java side, as well as control (most of the) Solr operations from the
Python side.


CONFIGURATION AND FEATURES
--------------------------

MontySolr (what you get when you download and extract montysolr-x.y.tgz) is only
an extension for Solr. You will need a separate Solr instance as well as a few
dependencies to use MontySolr.


More about configuration:
 * Install, upgrade, and maintaince:
   See INSTALL.txt in the same directory as this document.
 * Learn about how to extend MontySolr:
   See docs/technical-details.txt
 * See also: https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/rcarepo/wiki/MontySolr


DEVELOPING FOR MONTYSOLR
------------------------

MontySolr contains very simple API and the layer between Solr and Python is 
intentionally kept minimal. In most cases you simply want to use MontySolr just
as a communication layer between Solr and your own Python-written system. In this
case you don't need to make any changes inside MontySolr, but you will write simple
Python code that controls the business logic between Solr and Python.

More about writing wrappers to call your Python system(s):
  * Hello world example
    See docs/hello-world.txt
  * To understand details of the wrappers
    See docs/how-to-wrap.txt



If you need new functionality that is not present in MontySolr, search for
existing solutions or discussion on the mailing list:
